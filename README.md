<h1 align="center">Hi 👋, I'm @nepinhum</h1>
<p>Eh... A strange person who's torn between doing something or not doing :P</p>

 My name is ‘Nepinhum’ but mostly known as Scher & Scheria, these come from my other nickname ‘schermann’, which was first ‘schachmann’. I'm a 20-year-old self-taught developer who loves awareness. 

Some of my projects:
- [TrollXD](https://github.com/nxpinhum5326/TrollXD): A Troll plugin with an easy UI and advanced features for PocketMine.
- [callZebani](https://github.com/nxpinhum5326/callZebani): A ‘summon the devil’ themed website that I made for practical and entertainment purposes.
- [VillagerNames](https://github.com/nxpinhum5326/VillagerNames): A plugin that names villagers for PocketMine.
- [pmmpBuilder](https://github.com/nxpinhum5326/VillagerNames): PocketMine plugin basement builder written in C++.
- [JSONTranslator](https://github.com/AviothicMC/JSONTranslator): A simple JSON translator written in PHP.
